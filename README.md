# AnimateIt
Do you ever wanted to have an animated windows background? With AnimateIt you can select an image sequence and let it play frame per frame in the background. You can even select the wanted FPS-rate.
I made this description fast, so more is coming soon :)


The compiled exe can be found here: https://github.com/soomeone/AnimateIt/blob/master/AnimateIt/bin/Debug/AnimateIt.exe
You can start it in the console like this: AnimateIt.exe <image-folder> <fps>
Note: The images must be bmp
